## Getting & Cleaning Data Project

There is a growing interest in using devices to capture data about our movement. Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto at [SmartLab](www.smartlab.ws) ran an experiment where they had subjects go through a series of tests wearing a Samsung Galaxy SII in their hip.

They have released the raw and processed data from these experiments; however, the data is not in an easily understandable nor useable form. This project converts the data into two separate tidy datasets:
- `tidy-dataset.txt` contains the mean and standard deviation of each measurement for all subjects and tests.
- `tidy-dataset-2.txt` contains the mean measurement for each subject/test combination.

To download and tidy the data, simply run the `run_analysis.R` script.
